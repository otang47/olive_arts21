         Timeless sea breezes, <br>

sea-wind of the night:<br>

you come for no one;<br>

if someone should wake,<br>

he must be prepared<br>

how to survive you.<br>

Timeless sea breezes,<br>

that for aeons have<br>

blown ancient rocks,<br>

you are purest space<br>

coming from afarâ€¦<br>

Oh, how a fruit-bearing <br>

fig tree feels your coming<br>

high up in the moonlight.<br>

      The Ocean has its silent caves,<br> Deep, quiet, and alone;<br>

Though there be fury on the waves,<br>

Beneath them there is none.<br>

The awful spirits of the deep<br>

Hold their communion there;<br>

And there are those for whom we weep,<br>

The young, the bright, the fair.<br>

Calmly the wearied seamen rest<br>

Beneath their own blue sea.<br>

The ocean solitudes are blest,<br>

For there is purity.<br>

The earth has guilt, the earth has care,<br>

Unquiet are its graves;<br>
x
But peaceful sleep is ever there,<br>

Beneath the dark blue waves.<br>

<p>
   <span style="color:white; position: absolute; top: 400px; width: 500px;">
Gray sky, gray sea, gray mist between;<br>
And near and far the white-caps roll.<br>
They lift and sparkle, flash, careen,<br>
Then vanish, ere they reach a goal.<br>
</span>
