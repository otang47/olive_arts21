  	<h1>Should a pregnant person ever go to prison?</h1>  
  <div class="parallax-img"></div>
  <p>Though the Eight Amendment makes “cruel and unusual punishment” illegal, many incarcerated mothers have experienced the the cruel and unsual reality of giving birth in prison. Siwatu-Salama Ra was 26 years old, an environmental activist, a mother to one daughter, and 6 months pregnant with her second child when she was sent to the Huron Valley Correctional Facility.  </p>

<p> Dear [legislator, use their title: ex, Senator, Representative, State Representative], <br>

My name is [name], and I am a resident of [county/city/district]. I am [writing/calling] to you in strong support of Senate Bills 830 and 831, which would provide Pregnancy Standards of Care in prisons, and a Community Advisory Oversight Committee.<br>

Huron Valley Women’s prison has been chronically overcrowded for the last 6 years. In addition, the number of people being sent to prison who are pregnant has been on the rise. Prisons foster the conditions for abuse, neglect, and misuse of power. This has led to imprisoned women and people are giving birth in the most inhumane conditions at public funded Michigan prisons. Transparency and expert oversight at Michigan’s overcrowded women’s prison is a civic responsibility.<br>

[personal story if you want]<br>

I strongly urge you to support Senate Bills 830 and 831. Thank you for your time.<br>

Best,<br>

[name]
