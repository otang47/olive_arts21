	      	“The whole narrative around seafood has become wrapped up in conserving the ocean...it’s up for us to re engage in the bigger food systems…”--Dave Little, PhD, University of Stirling <br> <br>
	      </div>
	      <p>
	      	Too often has sustainable seafood seemed like a prohibitively complex web that the consumer must navigate on their own. We don’t think about seafood as an integral part of food systems like the American Staples of beef and spinach. Instead it is an environmentalist's burden, a fringe worry that the public doesn't have the bandwidth to consider. 
	      	This design seeks to upend those misconceptions.

	      </h2>
	      <p>
	      	The objectives of this project are two-fold: <br>
	      	1. Formalize connections between local fisheries and consumers on a platform curated with features that allow access to cheap, quality, and sustainable seafood.<br>
	      	2. Reorient seafood as a food market which decreases anxiety about purcashing, increases knowledge about its nutritional and environmental benefits, and makes consumers seriously consider it as an alternate protein source.

	      	“ ...a [purely] consumer focused platform is the wrong strategy... allowing fishmongers to share education tools with the consumer would be really valuable...most powerful is generating interest in learning more.”
	      	Kim Thompson-Program Manager at Aquarium for the Pacific’s Seafood For the Future <br>
	      	“...everyone with access provides value, like Uber. You can connect consumers to producers say “hey we’re here!” via a mapping system."

	      <h2>Visual Language: Color and Type</h2>
	      <p>
	      	I took inspiration from existing food apps to orient this project in the same realm as food delivery services. It should seem familiar, unintimidating, and friendly even to the consumer unfamiliar with seafood.

	      	The collaged graphic elements add consistency to the seller provided photos and bring in an aspect of education to interrupt what would otherwise be a purely commercial experience. It also brings in a sense of warmth with the sellers, fostering local community between fisheries and their buyers.
