	      </h2>
	      <p>
	      	The objectives of this project are to document the timeline of the kappa's changing nature. This is exemplified through the sidebar navigations that brings the user to explore literature on the kappa chronologically.

	      <h2>Research</h2>
	      <p>
	      	The quotes are sourced from Michael Dylan Foster's <span style="font-style: italic"> Folklore to Folkorism </span>--a premiere English text for Japanese yokai history.

	      <h2>Visual Language: Illustrations</h2>
	      <p>
	      	Kappa are immortalized in literature and paintings and the spoken word, all mediums that are similar to children's storybooks. I wanted to embody both the archiac feeling of flipping through a story but use animation to add a sense of magic and spirituality. Much like the moving photos of Harry Potter, this fanpage is enchanted.

	    <div class="column">
	      <h2>Interactions</h2>
	      <p>
	      	Adjectives of interest are colored differently and when hovered over, a kappa illustration appears. The illustration reflects the nature of the description and, as the user progresses through the timeline, the frequency of each character will grow and fade, reflecting changing kappa attitudes.
